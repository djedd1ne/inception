<h5>Docker</h5>
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.
<h5>Docker Compose</h5>
Docker Compose is a tool you can use to define and share multi-container applications. This means you can run a project with multiple containers using a single source.
<h5>Docker Container</h5>
A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
